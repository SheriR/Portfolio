      <p>My name is Sheri Rhoades and I am working to become a full stack programer at KU.</p>     
      
      <p>I currently live in Olathe, KS with my husband and two girls.  I grew up outside a very small town in central Iowa and moved to Kansas in 1996 with my husband.  We have the traditional mixed family :-).  Our two girls are 13 and 6.  My husband has two grown daughters who have children of their own.  Our youngest daughter is younger than one of her neices and one of her newphews.  Makes family get togethers even more fun!</p>
